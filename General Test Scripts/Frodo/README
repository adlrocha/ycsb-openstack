File List:

1. caluavgutil.py: It gets the real-time utilizations of all four servers from the Visualizee, calculates the average value, and sends it back to "visualizee.greencpd.openstackTest.rack.r01.server.cpu-util-avg".

2. config: Saves all parameters of launching new virtual machines. The Start and End sections regulate the duration of VMs in seconds. The Read and Write sections regulate the proportion of read and write operations. The Operations section define the total operations to be tested, but often set to be a large value to ensure the VM keeping running until it reaches the time to be terminated. The Thread section rules the total threads of running the test. The Target section determines how many operations to be executed in one second. So it is strongly related to the utilization. If the Target value is too high, the actual target value will not reach the assigned value because of the battleneck.

3. vmtest.py: Python script for reading the config file and execute it.

4. startworkloadmodel and workloadmodel: Two model files for generating the two actual config files for the newly-launched VM to download.


Things to Do in Frodo:

1. Change to allow SSH public key auth:
	1)Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config, add(de-comment):
	"RSAAuthentication yes"
	"PubkeyAuthentication yes"
	2)Restart SSH service by:
	"sudo service sshd restart"

2. Make public & private keys:
	1)Make a new user for the VM to download the config files
	"useradd", "passwd", ...
	2)Switch to the new user and generate new keys:
	"ssh-keygen" with no passphrase
	3)Copy the new private key file "id_rsa" to /home/centos/.ssh of the VM and "/home/newusername/.ssh" of Frodo.

3. Set the right permission to the two key files:
	The two key files on each system should be set to '600' : "chmod 600 /home/centos/.ssh/id_rsa" in the VM and "chmod 600 /home/centos/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" in Frodo.
	The two ~/.ssh folders should be granted 700 permission. 

4. Run 'caluavgutil.py' first to have the overall utilization uploaded to Visualizee. Leave it in 'tmux'.

5. Modify the config file 'config' with your own parameters and run 'vmtest.py' with sudo privilege and source the keystone of Openstack. It will generate a log file 'optlog'. It is better to leave it in 'tmux' so that it keeps runnning even if you disconnect the SSH session.
