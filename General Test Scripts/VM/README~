How to run this script on virtual machines?

Things to do in the VM

1. You need to follow the rules on the main page of the repository.

2. Copy this script to /home/centos  on the VM.

3. Set this script run by adding it into rc.local:
	(1) add "/home/centos/start" to /etc/rc.d/rc.local
	(2) set execution permissions by "chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local" and "chmod +x /home/centos/start" with root access.
	(3) enable sudo to run without launching tty, otherwise this will block the script from starting Cassandra. Just edit the file /etc/sudoers, comment "Defaults    requiretty". But this file is read-only. You need to perform "sudo chmod +w /etc/sudoers", edit it, and execute "sudo chmod -w /etc/sudoers" to ensure it is valid again.

4. Save the snapshot if works
